1. (4) The T-shirt fabric is soft and comfortable, but the color fades slightly after washing.
2. (5) Perfect fit! The material is high quality and the stitching is durable. Very satisfied!
3. (2) Shrunk significantly after first wash. Now it's too tight to wear. Very disappointed.
4. (3) The design is nice but the fabric is thinner than expected. Okay for the price.
5. (1) Poor quality! The seams started unraveling after two wears. Waste of money.
6. (5) Love this T-shirt! The cotton is breathable and the print hasn't cracked after multiple washes.
7. (4) Good basic tee. Comfortable for daily wear, though the neckline is a bit tight.
8. (2) Sizing is inconsistent. Ordered my usual size but it's too large. Return process was complicated.
9. (3) The fabric is decent but the color doesn't match the website image. It's more dull in person.
10. (5) Best T-shirt I've bought this year! Holds shape well and doesn't wrinkle easily.
11. (1) The print was cracked and peeling when it arrived. Customer service hasn't responded.
12. (4) Great for workouts! Moisture-wicking fabric works well. Only complaint is the short sleeves.
13. (3) Average quality. It's comfortable but shows sweat stains easily. Not for hot weather.
14. (5) Excellent value for money. Soft, thick cotton that doesn't shrink. Will order more colors!
15. (2) The collar stretched out after just three wears. Now it looks sloppy and old.
16. (4) Nice vintage feel to the fabric. The distressed design looks good. Shipping was slower than expected.
17. (1) The shirt arrived with a small hole near the hem. Quality control is lacking.
18. (5) Perfect everyday T-shirt! The fit is just right - not too tight, not too loose.
19. (3) Material is okay but it attracts lint like crazy. Have to use a lint roller constantly.
20. (4) Good thickness, doesn't become see-through when stretched. The color is vibrant.
21. (2) The sleeves are oddly short. Makes my arms look disproportionate. Unflattering cut.
22. (5) Super soft organic cotton! Worth the higher price. Feels luxurious against the skin.
23. (1) The shirt smells strongly of chemicals even after washing twice. Can't wear it.
24. (3) It's comfortable but the length is too long for my liking. Had to get it hemmed.
25. (4) Great for layering. The fabric has a nice weight to it. Holds up well in the dryer.
26. (2) The graphic started peeling after first wash. Followed care instructions exactly.
27. (5) The perfect white T-shirt! Not see-through at all. Finally found my go-to basic.
28. (1) The stitching came apart at the shoulder seam. Poor construction for the price.
29. (4) Love the slim fit design. Makes me look more put together. Fabric could be softer though.
30. (3) It's an okay T-shirt. Nothing special but gets the job done. Wouldn't buy again at full price.
